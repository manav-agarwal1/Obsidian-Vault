- Largest prime factor of a very large number. [[Integer Factorization]]
	- Used the fact that primes are 2,3 or of the form $6n-1$ or $6n+1$.
- Largest Palindrome which is product of $2-n$ digit numbers
	- Any palindrome with even digit is divisible by $11$ from divisibility rule.
	- If $n$ is even then there is nice pattern.

- LCM of 1...n
	- Building solution up from previous $n$.
	- Try to find closed form of time complexity.
- $n^{th}$ prime
	- A simple [[Sieve of Eratosthenes]] implementation can work.
	- Though if there is not upper bound on $n$ then best way is to:
		- Implement a good primality test and check for all number of form $6n \pm 1$.
