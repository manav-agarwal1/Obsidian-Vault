**Prime Number Theorem**
we know that if $\pi(n)$ is number of primes $\lt n$ then, $$\lim_{n \,\to \infty} \frac{\pi(n)}{\frac{n}{log(n)}} = 1$$
Probability that $n$ is prime = $\frac{1}{ln(n)}$
Expected number of trials to get success from [[Expectation]] of [[Geometric Distribution]] is, $ln(n)$.
So, if we are not off by a lot then the desired prime number is of same digits (same *bit*), if that is the case then as per expected number of trials we only need to check $ln(n)$ primes around $n$. Eg, if $n = 2^{1024}$ ie; we want a $1024$ bit prime, then we need to check $ln (2^{1024}) \approx 710$ randomly chosen $1024$ bit numbers for primality.
Actually, we only need to check $ln(n)/2$ as we only need to check odd numbers.
***
One Simple Test is [[Trial Division Primality Test]].
but it has limitations.
***
Other low error practical approach is [[Pseudoprimality Testing]].
***
Better test than previous one is [[Miller-Rabin Primality Test]].
