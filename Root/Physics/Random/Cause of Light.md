## Electric Field
It associates each point in 3D space with a 3D vector telling what force would be applied to a hypothetical unit charge sitting at that point in the space.

**Key** => So, if we have a charged particle and something causes it to wiggle then it causes a ripple in the Electric field in direction away from the charge. This *Propagation travels with the [c](Physics_Constants.md##Speed_of_Light).* Then as soon as this propagation reaches to another charged particle it causes it to wiggle albeit weakly than initial particle and, in turn we get a new propagation.
So, [c](Physics_Constants.md##Speed_of_Light) is not just speed of light, but **speed of causality: speed at which any influence travels, it just happens to be speed of light as well.**

If we have multiple charges accelerating(wiggling in sync) together in a sinusoidal fashion then the *net effect on the electric field is **superposition** of individual influence*. If we have a whole plane of charges then everywhere else the propagation cancels out but in the direction perpendicular to that plane. And, this is how we get a light beam. Even far away from this plane we get a nice sinusoidal propagation which we call light.
