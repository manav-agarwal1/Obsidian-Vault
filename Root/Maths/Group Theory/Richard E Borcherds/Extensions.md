- **Order 8**: Elements of $G$ has order dividing $8$ ie; $1,2,4,8$
	- It will have element with **order $2$**: 
		- Let there be an element $a$ of order $8$ then $a^8 = e \implies (a^4)^2 = e$. So, $a^4$ has order $2$.
		- Let there be an element $a$ of order $4$, then $a^2$ will have order $2$.
	- It will have an element of **order 4**:
		- Let there be $a$ such that $a^8 = e$ then, $(a^2)^4 = e$, so, $a^2$ has order $4$.
		- If there are only elements of order $1,2$ then we can use the concept of [[Maths/Group Theory/Richard E Borcherds/Products|Elementary Abelian p-groups]], and say $G \cong \mathcal{Z}/2\mathcal{Z} \times \mathcal{Z}/2\mathcal{Z} \times \mathcal{Z}/2\mathcal{Z}$.
			- So, we as well assume $G$ has an element $g$ of **order $4$**.
				- And, subgroup generated by it will have **index** of $2$ so, it will be a **normal subgroup**. It will be **isomorphic** to $\mathcal{Z}/4\mathcal{Z}$.
	- We can say $$1 \to \mathcal{Z}/4\mathcal{Z} \to G \to \mathcal{Z}/2\mathcal{Z} \to 1$$
		- So, $\mathcal{Z}/4\mathcal{Z}$ is **isomorphic** to subgroup of $G$ and **Quotient** of $G$ by $\mathcal{Z}/4\mathcal{Z}$ is **isomorphic** to $\mathcal{Z}/2\mathcal{Z}$ which is obvious as $\mathcal{Z}/4\mathcal{Z}$ has only $2$ **cosets** so, $G/(\mathcal{Z}/4\mathcal{Z})$ has $2$ elements.

So, we know $A$ and $B$  in $1 \to A \xrightarrow{\text{f}} G \xrightarrow{\text{f'}} B \to 1$ and want to find $G$. This is typical **extension** problem. $G$ is **extension** of $B$ by $A$. $A$ is **isomorphic** to subgroup in $G$ and $G/A$ is **isomorphic** to $B$.

Let, $a \in A$ such that $a^4 = 1$, and $A$ is **normal subgroup** in $G$ and,
$b \in G$ mapping to order $2$ in $B$ (*This doesn't mean $b$ has order $2$ in $G$ but it means image of $b$ in $B$ has order $2$*.)
**conjugation** fixes **normal subgroup**, so $b^{-1}Ab = A, \forall\, b \in G$.
We know that $B$ **normalizes** $A$ ie; $$b^{-1}ab = a \, (or,\, a^{-1})$$
because $a$ is a generator of $A$ so, it should be mapped to one of the generators $a$ or $a^3 = a^{-1}$.
And, $f'(b)^2 = f'(b)f'(b) = f'(b^2) = 1$, so, $b^2 \in ker(f')$, and $ker(f') = A$ so, $b^2 \in A$.
So, $b^2$ can be $\{1, a, a^2, a^3\}$, but by some reasoning Professor says $b^2 = a^3$ then replace $a$ by $a^{-1}$ that will render $3$ possibilities of $b^2$ namely, $\{1, a, a^2\}$.

So, we have $3$ equations, $a^4 = 1$, $b^{-1}ab$ with $2$ possibilities and $b^2$ with $3$ possibilities, so, we have in total $6$ possibilities.
- $b^{-1}ab = a$
	- $b^2 = 1$: $b$ generates a subgroup of **order** $2$. $\mathcal{Z}/2\mathcal{Z} \times \mathcal{Z}/4\mathcal{Z}$ where first one is $B$ and second one is $A$. We get a **split extension** here.
	- $b^2 = a$: $a^4 = b^8 = 1$, so, we get **cyclic group** $\mathcal{Z}/8\mathcal{Z} = \{1, b^2, b^4, b^6\}$.
	- $b^2 = a^2$: If, $c = ab  \implies c^2 = a^2b^2 = a^4 = 1$, then $c^{-1}ac = 1$, and this case is same as case of $b^2 = 1$.
- $b^{-1}ab = a^{-1}$
	- $b^2 = 1$: we get a **semidirect product**. $\mathcal{Z}/4\mathcal{Z} \rtimes \mathcal{Z}/2\mathcal{Z}$, where second one is $B$ and it is acting on **normal subgroup** $A$. We get *group of all symmetries of a square* this is called **Dihedral Group ($D_8$)**.
	- $b^2 = a$: This implies $ba = bb^2 = bbb = b^2b = ab$, so $b$ commutes with $a$, then $a = a^{-1}$, but $a^{-1} = a^3$. So, case doesn't exists.
- $b^2 = a^2$: $b^4 = 1$, $a^4 = 1$, **Quarternion Group ($Q_8$)**.
	- take $a = (\begin{smallmatrix} i & 0 \\ 0 & -i \end{smallmatrix})$, $i^2 = 1$
	- and take, $b = (\begin{smallmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0 \end{smallmatrix})$
		- $a^4 = 1 = b^4$ and $b^{-1}ab = a^{-1}$
	- and take, $c = (\begin{smallmatrix} 0 & i \\ i & 0 \end{smallmatrix})$
	- and take, $\mathcal{I} = (\begin{smallmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{smallmatrix})$
	- Then $G = \{\pm a, \pm b, \pm c,\pm\mathcal{I}\}$ 
		- $G$ is group of **order $8$**
		- $a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = abc = -\mathcal{I}$
