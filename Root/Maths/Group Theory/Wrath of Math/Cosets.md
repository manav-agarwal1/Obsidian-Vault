- **Left Coset of $H$ in $G$** = Let, $G$ be a group and $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. For any $x \in G$, we let $xH = \{xh \, | \, h\in H\}$, where $x$ remains fixed in $G$.
- **Right Coset of $H$ in $G$*** = Let, $G$ be a group and $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. For any $x \in G$, we let $Hx = \{hx \, | \, h\in H\}$, where $x$ remains fixed in $G$.
- Every **Coset** in $G$ subset of $G$. These $xH$ or $Hx$ might not belong to $H$ but they certainly belong to $G$.

*Eg:* $G = (\mathcal{Z}_4, +)$, $H = \{0, 2\}$.
$H+1 = \{1, 3\}$
$H+3 = \{3, 1\}$
As, $1$ and $3$ belongs to each other **cosets** their generated **cosets** will be same.
$2 + H = \{2, 0\}$
$0 + H = \{0, 2\}$
***cosets** partition a group*.

- The **cosets** $Ha$ as $a$ ranges over in $G$, is a partition of $G$. $G/H = \{Ha \, | \, a\in G\}$

**Corollary**: If $a \in Hb$ then $Ha = Hb$.
**Prove**:
If $a\in Hb \to a = h_1b \to h_1^{-1}a = b$ for some $h_1 \in H$.
Take $x \in Ha$, then $x = h_2a = h_2(h_1b)=(h_2h_1)b \in Hb$ for some $h_2 \in H$. $\therefore$ $ha \subseteq hb$. Similarly, $hb \subseteq ha$.
Hence, $Ha = Hb$.
***
**Corollary**: If a group $G$ and subgroup $H$, $H + 0$ is the only coset with $0$ then any other coset with $0$ mush be coset $H+0$. Thus, $H+0$ is the only coset in $G$ which is also a subgroup. So, any other **coset** can be a subset of $G$ but cannot be a subgroup.
