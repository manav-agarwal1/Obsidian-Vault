But these functions are constants over equally spaced time units so, we can deal with them like discrete case.
$1 \, x \, [-3 -1\, 1]$ = -3 -1 1
$-2 \, x \, [-3 -1\, 1]$ =    6 2 -2
$2 \, x \, [-3 -1\, 1]$ =         -6 -2 2

                    0 -3 5 -3 -4 2 0

Only works because these things are constants over equally spaced time units.
