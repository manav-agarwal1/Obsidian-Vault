## What are Signals?

A function:
- maybe $x(t): \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$
	- Domain could be *Time*
	- Range could be something like *Pressure, Voltage, Light, etc*.
- maybe $f(x, y): \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$
	- Maybe in image processing setting.
	- Range could be $\mathbb{R}^3$ which could be RGB image.
- maybe $f(x,y,z)$ or $(x,y,z,t)$ with time too.
- General sense signal, $$r(t) = S(t) + w(t)$$
	- Where $S(t)$ is message and $w(t)$ is the noise.



## What are Systems?

Things that map signals to another signal.
