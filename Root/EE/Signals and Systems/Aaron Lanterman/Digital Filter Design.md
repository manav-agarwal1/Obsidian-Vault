 *This lecture talks about **Digital Filter Design** using **Pole-Zero Mapping***.

# Butterworth Filters

**Poles** in case of these filters are equally spaced, on the circle with radius $\omega_c$ in **s-Plane**.
**Order of Butterworth Filter $N$** = Number of poles, in the $LHS$.

Actually there are $2N$ **poles**, but we don't talk about *Theoretical **Poles*** on the $RHS$ as they are not **system stability friendly**.
Higher the **order**, more close to a **ideal filter**, out **butterworth filter** will be.
