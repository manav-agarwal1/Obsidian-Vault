# Integers mod $n$ ($\mathcal {Z}_n$)

**Preposition**: Let $\mathcal{Z}_n$ be defined as known then:
1. Addition and multiplication are commutative
2. Addition and multiplication are associative
3. There are both addition and multiplication identities
4. Multiplication distributes over addition
5. For every integer $a$ there is additive inverse $-a$
6. Let $a$ be nonzero integer. Then
