**Browser** allows people to talk to another computer (server), and get back some HTML/CSS and render it on the screen. This render of HTML/CSS or whatever comes from that other computer is done as per some specification.

**Why HTML/CSS/JS?**
Browser can be built to understand other languages as well, but at minimum these languages are need to spin up any website (some exceptions based on use case). There are obviously frameworks but the are not part of the bare minimum.

# HTML

It defines structure of the website (what to be placed, where to be placed).
- html - not important in modern day html.
- head - structural tag, we put metadata here, so, like title tag, which doesn't need to render in the main body.
- title - Whatever written here gets rendered at the top of the tab.
- body - structural tag
- div/span
	- div = $1$ full line of your page, I can just have these.
	- span = take only space needed not whole line.
- h<1-6>
- p
- img
- a
- input
- button
- b/i
- center
HTML gives us tools to create but not to style.

**Attributes** = Sometimes we need to achieve some function and for that we put attributes in tags.
