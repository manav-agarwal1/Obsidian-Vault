# Thought Experiment 1
*Imagine we have a box that outputs $1/day. How much would you pay for this box*?
**Ans**:
- Instead of a box let's take a *Savings Account* and think it gave you $1.05\%$ interest annually. How much would you put in this account to generate $1/day ?
	- ![[Pasted image 20231226135006.png]]
	- Per day rates can be obtained by *dividing by $365$*.
	- This is a large amount, and it is so, because we get small interest rate on our savings account.

# Thought Experiment 2
*Imagine you want to buy a house, and market price is $100,000, $20,000 towards down payment, and $80,000 Mortgage*. How much will you have to pay to get rid of Mortgage?
**Ans**: 
![[Pasted image 20231226135414.png]]
![[Pasted image 20231226135542.png]]If we are paying $9,396.77 then it would take about $20$ years to pay the loan, and this is due to the interest rate applied on this mortgage.
We can see in image that each year principal is reduced by very less and majority of payment is going towards payment of interest (Interest rate on your principal in that year). However, as principal decreases it diminishes with time.

# Return of Investment (ROI)

- ROI measures the amount of return of an investment relative to amount invested.
- $$ ROI = \frac{\text{Current Value of Investment - Cost of Investment}}{\text{Cost of Investment}} $$
- Basic Measure of Profitability.
- Though not the ultimate measurement.
	- Doesn't account for how much time it took to get that ROI, so can be bad for comparisons sometime.
	- ![[Pasted image 20231226160351.png]]
		- It said second investment is good but actually first one is good.

# Time Value of Money

- If we have a savings account with $10\%$ for $20$ years, this is how money is multiplied by over the period.![[Pasted image 20231226160652.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20231226160707.png]]
	- This is **continuous compounding**.
- It says *Money has more power today than in the future*. Because the power decreases due to [[Macroeconomics]] effects like [[Inflation]]
- $$\text{Future Value} = \text{Present Value} \cdot (1 + \text{Interest Rate})^{\text{n periods}}$$
# Net Present Value

- *Inflows* vs *Outflows*
- Should be $\gt0$ for investment to be great.
- **Discount Rate**: Interest Rate used to determine present value of future cashflows in a discounted cashflow analysis.
	- We use it to calculate effect of **Macroeconomic** factors such as **Inflation** which will decrease value of money in future.
- *Eg*: You purchased a vending machine @$10,000, and subsequently profits are![[Pasted image 20231226161421.png]]
	- Simply adding numbers on left column we get $7,000 but accounting for Discount Rate we get $4,704.
	- ![[Pasted image 20231226162353.png]]
- Limitations: Making assumption about future, so, only as good as assumption.
